## Usage

When you first load up the website, you will be greeted by a landing page. To get started with taking notes, simply click the "get started" button.

After clicking the "get started" button, you will see two columns: the column on the left is for past saved notes, and the column on the right is for new notes. To add a new note, simply type in a title and some text in the unpopulated text areas, then click the save icon that will appear in the top-right. If you wish to review an old note, click on the title of any note in the left column, and the right column will be populated with the contents of that note. To write a new note after that, simply click the plus icon in the top-right.

Currently, the website does not have a delete note functionality, despite the existence of the delete icons; that will be added in the future.

You can find the deployed page here: https://lsaa-notetaker.herokuapp.com/
